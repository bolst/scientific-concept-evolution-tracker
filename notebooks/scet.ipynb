    "## Hybrid Search Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can implement the search logic. We will use a hybrid search:\n",
    "1.  *Dense vector search*: Finds semantically similar papers (good for concept matching)\n",
    "2.  *Sparse vector search*: Finds keyword-based matches (good for precision)\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a `WeightedRanker` to combine these scores. We can adjust the `alpha` parameter to weight dense vs. sparse importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: in our hybrid search, we perform two independent searches (Dense and Sparse) and then combine the results. If we set the limit too low (e.g., 10), a paper that is ranked 15th in Dense and 15th in Sparse might not be retrieved by *either* search, even though its combined score might be higher than the top results. To fix this, we fetch a larger pool of candidates (e.g., 200) from each method before reranking."
